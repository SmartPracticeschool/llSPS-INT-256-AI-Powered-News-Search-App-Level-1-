AI Powered News Search App (Level-1)
The purpose of this project is to build a user friendly News Search Application which makes it easier for the users to find relevant
news articles according to their interests and queries. All we need to do is give relevant keywords regarding the required news to the
chatbot so that it can fetch the news articles and links.  This app also determines the sentiment of the article.
The news apps that are currently available contain huge data and is often quite perplexing to the user to search for a particular 
article from a substantial amount of data. It is also not possible to determine the tone or the sentiment of the required news using 
the apps that are available.
Creating a news search application using IBM discovery service available in IBM cloud. When integrated with Node Red Flow, IBM discovery 
service creates an easy to access news hunting application which fetches the user with relevant news from a vast data since IBM discovery 
service always updates itself with the latest news. We can also add sentiment analysis to make the app UI more unique and user friendly.
